# reach-me

A Startup Weekend project founded on the idea that when people leave their university, they have to let their contacts know that they are moving to a new email. This project lets people upload their contact information to a server that automatically pushes out to people, so when they attempt to contact they will have the newest information. See [reach-android-client](https://github.com/johnameyer/reach-android-client) for API implementation and intended use.
